   We present a real-time, touchless human-computer interaction (HCI) system for media control using a standard webcam. Our approach combines a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for static hand pose recognition with a heuristic zone-based tracking system for dynamic navigation. The system extracts 63-dimensional skeletal features using MediaPipe Hands to classify four static gestures (Stop, Fist, Like, Thumbs Down) with high accuracy. To address the limitations of velocity-based swipe detection, we introduce a robust zone-transition mechanism for track navigation. Experimental results demonstrate that this hybrid architecture achieves reliable performance with minimal computational overhead, making it suitable for deployment on consumer hardware.
