   We present a practical, touchless human-computer interaction system for laptop media control that runs entirely on commodity hardware. The interface combines a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for static hand pose recognition with a deterministic zone-based state machine for swipe navigation, all driven by 63-dimensional features extracted from MediaPipe Hands. Four static gestures (Stop, Fist, Like, Thumbs Down) are mapped to play/pause, mute, and volume adjustments, while lateral swipes reliably trigger track changes without requiring velocity thresholds. Experiments on an 800-sample dataset and a real-time deployment demo show that the hybrid design delivers stable predictions at $	extasciitilde$60 FPS with negligible CPU overhead, making it ready for household and classroom settings.
