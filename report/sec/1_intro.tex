\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Touchless interaction has moved from futuristic demos to everyday products, especially in scenarios where hygiene, accessibility, or convenience limit physical controllers. Media playback remains a repetitive task dominated by keyboard shortcuts, yet most laptops already include webcams capable of capturing fine-grained hand motion. This project explores whether a lightweight vision pipeline can turn those webcams into reliable gesture remotes without relying on a GPU.

Our system keeps the model simple and the interaction consistent. We collect skeletal landmarks from MediaPipe Hands and train a small Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify four static gestures. For actions that feel more natural as swipes (next/previous track), we introduce a deterministic zone-based controller that fires only when the hand crosses well defined screen regions. Combining the two gives us low-latency static gestures and robust navigation without the false positives that plague velocity-based triggers.

In summary, we contribute (1) a CPU-friendly hand gesture recognizer powered by an SVM trained on 63-D landmark vectors, (2) a finite-state zone navigation scheme that removes the need for motion heuristics, and (3) an end-to-end Windows integration that maps gestures directly to system media shortcuts and demonstrates real-time use.

\subsection{Related Work}
Early gesture systems either segmented skin-color blobs or required depth sensors such as the Microsoft Kinect \cite{gesture_survey}. Modern pipelines leverage learning-based keypoint detectors; MediaPipe Hands in particular offers accurate 3D landmarks from a single RGB input and runs efficiently on laptops \cite{mediapipe}. Once landmarks are available, classical classifiers such as SVMs remain competitive because they operate on compact feature vectors and offer strong decision boundaries \cite{svm}. Toolkits like scikit-learn simplify deployment of such models and provide calibrated probabilities that help us filter noisy frames \cite{scikit-learn}.
