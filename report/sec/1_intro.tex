\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Touchless interfaces have gained significance for hygiene, accessibility, and convenience. This project aims to replace standard keyboard media shortcuts with intuitive hand gestures. Unlike complex deep learning models requiring heavy GPUs, our solution leverages lightweight skeletal tracking and classical machine learning to ensure real-time performance on CPU.

The primary contributions of this work are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A lightweight SVM-based classifier for static gesture recognition.
    \item A robust zone-based interaction model for dynamic navigation that reduces user fatigue.
    \item A real-time integration with Windows system audio and media controls.
\end{itemize}
