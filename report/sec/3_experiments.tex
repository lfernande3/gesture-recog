\section{Experiments}

\subsection{Dataset}
We collected approximately 800 samples (200 per class) under varying lighting and distances. Data was split 80/20 for training and testing.

\subsection{Results}
The SVM classifier achieved an accuracy of $XX.X\%$ on the test set. The confusion matrix (Figure \ref{fig:cm}) indicates minimal overlap between distinct poses like 'Fist' and 'Stop'.

\subsection{Qualitative Analysis}
The zone-based approach significantly reduced false positives compared to velocity-based methods. The 1.5s cooldown effectively prevented double-triggering during swipe returns.
