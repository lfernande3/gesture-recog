\section{Conclusion}
We successfully developed a low-latency gesture control system. The hybrid approach of combining SVM for static poses with zone logic for dynamic swipes proved effective in reducing false positives and user fatigue. Future work includes adding dynamic gesture sequences and multi-hand support.
