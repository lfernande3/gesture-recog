\section{Conclusion}
The project demonstrates that a webcam plus a lightweight SVM is enough to deliver a dependable media controller. By separating static gestures from swipe navigation and adding temporal filtering, we obtained a system that feels immediate yet rarely misfires. The full implementation, including dataset, notebook, and real-time demo script, is released so classmates can reproduce or extend the interface.

\subsection{Future Work}
Looking ahead, we plan to (1) add dynamic sequences via temporal models such as LSTMs to capture gestures like "wave" or "circle", (2) auto-calibrate zone boundaries for different aspect ratios or external webcams, and (3) explore multi-hand combinations that could map to richer controls such as scrubbing or playlist selection.
