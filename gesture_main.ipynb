    "# Static Hand Gesture UI Control\n",
    "\n",
    "**Course Project:** Computer Vision Applications  \n",
    "**Goal:** Control PC volume and media playback using real-time static hand gestures.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "This project implements a touchless interface using a standard webcam. It detects hand landmarks using **MediaPipe Hands**, extracts a 63-dimensional feature vector (21 points × x,y,z), and classifies the pose using a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**. The recognized gestures are then mapped to system actions (Volume Up/Down, Mute, Play/Pause) via Python automation libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workflow\n",
    "1.  **Data Collection:** Capture labeled landmark samples for 5 gestures (Stop, Fist, Victory, Like, OK).\n",
    "2.  **Model Training:** Train a lightweight SVM classifier on the collected dataset.\n",
    "3.  **Real-Time Demo:** Run a live inference loop to control the PC.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup Instructions\n",
    "1.  **Create Environment:**\n",
    "    ```powershell\n",
    "    python -m venv .venv\n",
    "    .\\.venv\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "2.  **Install Dependencies:**\n",
    "    ```powershell\n",
    "    pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "3.  **Run Notebook:** Execute the cells below in order."

    "## Data Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "This module captures landmark coordinate samples for training the SVM classifier. The system records 63-dimensional feature vectors (21 MediaPipe hand landmarks × x,y,z coordinates) for four static gesture classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Class | Gesture | Description |\n",
    "|-------|---------|-------------|\n",
    "| 0 | Stop | Open palm, all fingers extended |\n",
    "| 1 | Fist | Closed hand |\n",
    "| 2 | Like | Thumbs up |\n",
    "| 3 | Thumbs Down | Thumb pointing downward |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Navigation gestures** (Next/Previous track) are implemented via zone-based detection and do not require training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Collection Protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** A pre-collected `gesture_data.csv` file is included in the repository for demonstration purposes. You can proceed directly to the training phase using this dataset. If you wish to collect fresh samples or customize the gestures, simply delete the existing CSV file and execute the cell below to record new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Environment Setup:**\n",
    "   - Activate virtual environment: `.\\.venv\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1`\n",
    "   - Verify dependencies installed: `pip list`\n",
    "   - Ensure adequate lighting and camera functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Recording Procedure:**\n",
    "   - Execute the cell below to launch the collection interface\n",
    "   - Press numeric keys `0`–`3` to begin recording each gesture class\n",
    "   - Hold each pose for 3–5 seconds while moving slightly to capture variance\n",
    "   - Press `SPACE` to pause between gesture transitions\n",
    "   - Target: **≥200 samples per class** (800 total minimum)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Augmentation:**\n",
    "   - Vary hand distance from camera (0.5m – 1.5m)\n",
    "   - Include slight rotations (±15°)\n",
    "   - Capture under different lighting conditions\n",
    "   - Use both left and right hands\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Output:**\n",
    "   - Press `q` to terminate and save\n",
    "   - Dataset saved to `gesture_data.csv` in project root\n",
    "   - Console displays per-class sample counts and validation status"

    "- Stability requirement: **3 consecutive frames**\n",
    "- Debounce interval: **1.1 seconds**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Zone-Based Navigation:**\n",
    "- Screen partitioned into three horizontal zones: LEFT (0–25%), CENTER (25–75%), RIGHT (75–100%)\n",
    "- Transitions from CENTER → edge zones trigger media navigation\n",
