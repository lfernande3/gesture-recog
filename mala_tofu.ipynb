    "# Static Hand Gesture UI Control\n",
    "\n",
    "**Course Project:** Computer Vision Applications  \n",
    "**Goal:** Control PC volume and media playback using real-time static hand gestures.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "This project implements a touchless interface using a standard webcam. It detects hand landmarks using **MediaPipe Hands**, extracts a 63-dimensional feature vector (21 points × x,y,z), and classifies the pose using a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**. The recognized gestures are then mapped to system actions (Volume Up/Down, Mute, Play/Pause) via Python automation libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workflow\n",
    "1.  **Data Collection:** Capture labeled landmark samples for 5 gestures (Stop, Fist, Victory, Like, OK).\n",
    "2.  **Model Training:** Train a lightweight SVM classifier on the collected dataset.\n",
    "3.  **Real-Time Demo:** Run a live inference loop to control the PC.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup Instructions\n",
    "1.  **Create Environment:**\n",
    "    ```powershell\n",
    "    python -m venv .venv\n",
    "    .\\.venv\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "2.  **Install Dependencies:**\n",
    "    ```powershell\n",
    "    pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "3.  **Run Notebook:** Execute the cells below in order."
